# Genpact-Case-Competition
Predict the propensity to pay of customers studying patterns from the historical payments.
Team lead to Team All Stars in the Genpact Case Competition. The goal was to  to develop a dynamic classification model using machine learning to predict whether a customer will default and in what timeframe. The timeframe element allows for additional customer segmentation based on whether they will default for 0-30, 30-60, or 60+ days. Based on the model built we generated business insights for Genpact and gave recommendation to prevent customers from defaulting. 
We placed 2nd in the competiton amongst 30+ teams.
